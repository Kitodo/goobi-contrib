The update scripts provided here help to perform minor updates on Kitodo 3.*
according to https://github.com/kitodo/kitodo-production/issues/3396.
The scripts support (nearly) each step described there, plus some additional (optional) parts.

Preconditions:
- Have available new version of modules jars in form of "modules.zip"
- Have available new WAR file
- Have available SQL-Script with updates to be performed in the database

Steps to follow:
1) saveConfigBeforeMinorUpdate
2) optional: saveMessagesBeforeMinorUpdate
3) saveModulesBeforeMinorUpdate
4) saveWARBeforeMinorUpdate
5) optional: saveDatabaseBeforeMinorUpdate
6) performDatabaseUpdateAsPartOfMinorUpdate
7) Optional: Delete Elastic Search Index according to description on GitHub
   I never have done this at this point of time, but made it via the Kitodo User-Interface (step 13), after everything was installed
8) installModulesAsPartOfMinorUpdate
9) installMessagesAsPartOfMinorUpdate
10) installWARAsPartOfMinorUpdate
11) restoreConfigAfterMinorUpdate
12) installWARAsPartOfMinorUpdatePart2
13) login to Kitodo and delete&re-create Index

Hint: If the WAR-files is named like "kitodo-something.war", the website has the same name: myserver.com:8080/kitodo-something
